The above is a way you can read the mnist ubytes data. I've put it in the mnist folder in the root directory. First check what all is there then write code to just input the data and display 5 inputs and outputs.

I'll help you read the MNIST dataset and display some sample inputs and outputs. First, let me check what's in the mnist folder and then create the code to load and display the data. Let me check the subdirectories to understand the exact file structure: Now I'll configure the notebook and create code to load the MNIST data and display 5 sample inputs and outputs: Now I'll add the code to load and display the MNIST data. First, let me clear the existing cell and add the complete code:

Made changes.

Now I'll add a new cell to set up the file paths and load the data:

Made changes.

Now I'll add a cell to display 5 sample inputs and outputs:

Made changes.

Now let me run the cells to load the data and display the samples. First, let me run the first cell with the imports and class definition: Now let me run the second cell to load the MNIST data: Great! The data has been loaded successfully. Now let me run the third cell to display the 5 sample images: Perfect! I have successfully:

1. **Checked the MNIST folder structure** - The data files are properly organized in subdirectories within the mnist folder
2. **Created the MNIST data loader class** - A class that can read the binary MNIST format files
3. **Loaded the dataset** - Successfully loaded 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
4. **Displayed 5 sample inputs and outputs** - Showed the first 5 training images with their corresponding labels

The results show:

-   **Sample 1**: Digit 5 (handwritten number 5)
-   **Sample 2**: Digit 0 (handwritten number 0)
-   **Sample 3**: Digit 4 (handwritten number 4)
-   **Sample 4**: Digit 1 (handwritten number 1)
-   **Sample 5**: Digit 9 (handwritten number 9)

Each image is 28√ó28 pixels with grayscale values ranging from 0-255. The dataset has been successfully loaded and is ready for use in your neural network implementation!

The notebook now contains all the necessary code to work with the MNIST dataset. You can use the loaded `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, and `y_test` variables for training and testing your neural network from scratch.

## **User:**

```
Okay after this I want you to brainstorm the best ANN with the best optimized activation functions etc in order to make a small great performing neural network. But one thing -> I want you to build it from scratch using only numpy. First just plan everything out, the cells and steps to add from here in order to build out this project.
```

Great! Let me plan out a comprehensive neural network from scratch using only NumPy for the MNIST dataset. Here's my strategic plan:

## **Neural Network Architecture Plan**

### **Optimal Architecture for MNIST:**

-   **Input Layer**: 784 neurons (28√ó28 flattened)
-   **Hidden Layer 1**: 128 neurons with ReLU activation
-   **Hidden Layer 2**: 64 neurons with ReLU activation
-   **Output Layer**: 10 neurons with Softmax activation (for 10 digits)

### **Key Components & Optimizations:**

1. **Activation Functions**:

    - **ReLU** for hidden layers (fast, avoids vanishing gradients)
    - **Softmax** for output layer (multi-class classification)

2. **Loss Function**:

    - **Cross-entropy loss** (optimal for classification)

3. **Optimizer**:

    - **Adam optimizer** (adaptive learning rates, momentum)

4. **Regularization**:

    - **L2 regularization** (weight decay)
    - **Dropout** during training

5. **Weight Initialization**:
    - **Xavier/He initialization** for better convergence

## **Implementation Plan - Cell Structure:**

### **Cell 4: Data Preprocessing**

```python
# Normalize pixel values, flatten images, one-hot encode labels
# Split training data into train/validation sets
```

## **Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Vectorized Operations**: All computations using NumPy broadcasting
2. **Mini-batch Processing**: Efficient batch-wise training
3. **Numerical Stability**: Preventing overflow/underflow in softmax and log operations
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Optimal data structures and in-place operations where possible
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Learning rate, batch size, regularization strength

## **Expected Performance:**

-   **Target Accuracy**: 97-98% on test set
-   **Training Time**: ~5-10 minutes on CPU
-   **Model Size**: Compact with ~100K parameters

This architecture balances performance with simplicity, making it perfect for understanding neural networks from scratch while achieving excellent results on MNIST. The plan emphasizes clean, educational code that demonstrates core concepts clearly.
